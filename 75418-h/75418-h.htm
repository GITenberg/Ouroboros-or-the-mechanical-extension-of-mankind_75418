<p><span class="smcap">One</span> story of us is continuous. It is
the story of our struggle to recapture the
Garden of Eden, meaning by that a state
of existence free from the doom of toil.</p>

<p>So long as the character of our economic
life was agricultural, as it almost wholly
was until a very recent time, the attack was
naïve. In the file of prayers, if one is
kept, the thickest, dustiest bundle is that of
our supplications for plenty—miraculous
plenty without worry or price. We were
loth to believe that the second arrangement
between God and Adam made at
the gate of exit:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">was forever; and for a long time
afterward local weather conditions were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
wistfully misunderstood, as a chastisement
when they were bad and a sign of relenting
when they were good. It was forever.
Nature’s ring was closed, never again to
open for any darling fructuary.</p>

<p>That is to say, man’s taking from the
soil is an arbitrary wage. He may increase
the gross of it a little by exerting himself
more: the scale he cannot alter. If tilth
for the individual has been made easier
somewhat and more productive by the use
of wheeled implements, power tools and
now airplanes to dust the orchard with insecticide,
these, you must remember, represent
a tremendous increase of effort by
mankind at large upon the principle of
limited fecundity that governs the earth.</p>

<p>When at length the realistic mind perceived
that here was a natural fact upon
which prayers, thanksgiving, sacrifice, idolatry,
and the pretentions of magic were all
alike wasted, the spiritual part of us no
doubt had been willing to accept the sentence.
Not so the earthy and lusty part.
The curse was heavy. There was never a
risk man would not take, no kind of heroic
exertion he would spare himself, to escape
the evil, the boredom, the drudgery of
repetitious toil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>From such puerile motivation came the
Age of Discovery, then physical science,
purposeful mechanical invention, the industrial
era, and all the artificial marvels
of the modern world. These effects are
historically traceable; and, if it should
occur to you to wonder why they are so
much more vivid and astonishing in the
West than in the East, that is easily explained.
The European mind went on
with the phantasy of an earthly paradise
of plenty and leisure after the Oriental
mind in weariness of wisdom had given it
up.</p>

<p>Until four hundred years ago the Europeans
believed that somewhere in the world
was a fabulous land whose inhabitants
lived as in dreams, eating and drinking
from golden vessels, wearing priceless
jewels like common beads, sated with ease
and luxury. King, courts, astronomers and
navigators believed this. The vulgar fancy
was for a place such as Cockaigne of the
medieval ballads, where all features of
the landscape were good to eat or drink and
nobody ever was obliged to work. In quest
of this mythical region the pioneer feats of
circumnavigation were performed.</p>

<p>What a disparity between the character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
of the motive and the shape of the dead!—or
is it that men do not know their
motives?</p>

<p>The earth was explored. It was found
to be round and full of labour. This, of
course, was a terrible disappointment.</p>

<p>The ceaseless mind then turned to
alchemy with the idea that base metals
were changeable into gold; from this
came chemistry and the study of matter
and physical phenomena in a new way,
taking nothing for granted. This was the
beginning of true Science. As to what
might come of it practically there was at
first only the rudest kind of notion. Dimly
it was understood that exact knowledge
must somehow increase man’s power, give
him control of the elementary circumstance,
enable him perhaps to command
that which hitherto he had got by hazard.
When a great body of fact-knowledge had
been accumulated, men began to see little
by little how it might be dynamically applied.
Then the epoch of Mechanical
Invention.</p>

<p>The idea of machines was not new.
Long before the beginning of the Christian
era the ancients had produced many
wonderful automatic devices; but mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
knowledge with them was a department
of magic. The use of machines was
to mystify the multitude. Brazen figures
were made to move, dragons to hiss,
temple doors to open and close, trees to
emit musical sounds, and lamps to trim
themselves perpetually by means of floats,
cogwheels, cylinders, valves, and pistons—all
acting on sound principles of pneumatics
and hydraulics. Much of this ancient technology
was lost or forgotten. The European
mind rediscovered it gradually in a
spirit of scientific curiosity, with no clear
economic intention. And, but for a simple
practical idea, one that was very slow to
come through, the machine no doubt would
still be what it anciently was—an object
of superstition, the toy of wonder, an accessory
of priestcraft.</p>

<p>And what an obvious idea it was!—merely
to exploit the machine’s slave value.
Merely to see an engine as a beast of burden
and the loom as a projection of the
hand, both instruments of magnified production,
to spare the labour of mankind.</p>

<p>That moment in which the use of mechanical
energy came to be so conceived
was one of elemental significance. All
the chances of human life were altered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
though not as anyone supposed or as they
were meant to be.</p>

<p>The course of internal evolution requires
to be imagined. It is slow beyond
perception. It may not be a fact; or, for
aught we know, it may be finished in the
species. Suddenly man begins to augment
himself by an external process. His natural
powers become extensible to a degree
that makes them original in kind. To his
given structure—the weakest among animal
structures in proportion to its bulk—he
adds an automatic, artificial member,
responsive only to his contact, answerable
only to his will, uncontrolled by nature,
fabulous in its possibilities of strength,
variation, and cunning.</p>

<p>His use of it in three generations has
changed the design of civilization out of
recognition. That change alone which sets
our time off abruptly from all time before
is the fact of potential plenty. We take
this for granted as if it were a natural fact,
whereas, instead, all the circumstances
have been invented.</p>

<p>We who are born to the view cannot
see it. We cannot imagine what it was
like to live in a world where famine was
a frequent visitation and all things were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
scarce. Yet never until now has the human
race known what plenty was. Immemorially
the word has signified food.</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a
field the Lord has blessed. God give thee of
the dew of the heaven and the fatness of the
earth and plenty of wine and corn.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The cornucopia, horn of plenty, never
contained a fabricated thing—only the
fruits of the earth.</p>

<p>That old meaning of the word has been
recently lost. Modernly we speak of
‘goods’; we talk of the standard of living,
which is understood of course to include
proper quantities of food, and to mean, besides
food, an endless number of artificial
things which people increasingly require
for their comfort and well-being.</p>

<p>Mechanical energy does not produce
food. Nor has the principle of limited
fecundity that governs the earth been suspended.
Yet the machine has enormously
increased the food-supply in two ways:
first, agriculture is equipped with power—tools,
so that one man now may perform
the labour of many; second, transportation
has made all the food-producing areas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of the world accessible, so that grain from
the middle of the North American continent
and grain from Argentina are
mingled unawares in the European loaf.</p>

<p>This use of the machine to distribute
food swiftly over the whole world from
where there is a surplus to where that surplus
is needed has had profound political,
economic, and social consequences, beginning
with an increase of the human species
vastly beyond any number that had at any
time previously existed or could ever before
have been sustained upon the earth. That
is the one most awesome phenomenon of
the industrial era. The North American
continent has been peopled from European
stock. Its present population is equal to
that of all Europe in 1800. This drain
of emigration notwithstanding, the population
of Europe in the same time has
trebled.</p>

<p>And still there is plenty.</p>

<p>Where it is not actual, it is potential.
Who have not plenty are either too inert
or too ignorant to put forth the modern
effort. What people may use, enjoy, and
consume now is an <em>x</em> quantity, determined
neither by the rhythms of nature nor any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
biological principle, but simply by the free
total of their own exertions.</p>

<p>Faster than the race has multiplied the
powers of the machine have increased.
One of these is the power of transportation,
whereby the food product of the
whole earth is made uniformly available.
The other power is represented by a divisible
product of artificial things tending to
exceed the sum of effective human desire.</p>

<p>To wishful desire there is no limit whatever;
but there is a point at which the
effort necessary to obtain the object—that
is, the toil—will be weighed against the
desire to possess it, and only when and if
the object is deemed worth the effort is
desire effective in the economic sense.</p>

<p>From the paradox mentioned—that
tendency of the machine’s divisible product
to overwhelm the sum of effective desire—we
get a series of complex phenomena
of which there is nowhere yet a complete
understanding.</p>

<p>This now is a buyer’s world where formerly
it was the seller’s. Business no
longer sits in Asiatic dignity waiting for
its customers; it must up and seek them.
The buyer is pursued.</p>

<p>As I write, the strains of a Liszt rhapsody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
float through my window. They
come from a farmer’s cottage a little way
down the road. Yesterday a motor-truck
stopped at his house and unloaded a self-playing
piano. I saw it and noticed that it
got slightly damaged squeezing through
the tiny doorway.</p>

<p>What does this mean? First, it means
that the day before yesterday a salesman
from the city went through this road selling
self-playing pianos for a nominal cash sum
down and the balance on monthly instalments.
He sold one there, another in the
next house but one, and a third further on.
How many he sold to the end of the road
I do not know.</p>

<p>But what does it mean that the city
sends a man through a country road in
southern New Jersey to sell pianos in this
beguiling manner to people who cannot
afford them? Those who bought them I
know were all in debt for other things
bought on the instalment plan. It means
there is a necessity to sell this industrial
product. It is the necessity of a factory
that has overtaken the normal demand
for self-playing pianos and must force the
sale of its surplus. It is the necessity of all
who work in that factory and live thereby.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
It is the necessity of industry in general,
governed as it is by a principle it did not
invent.</p>

<p>The principle is that the divisible product
of the machine is cheap in proportion
to the quantity. Remember that principle.
We shall meet it again.</p>

<p>As with player-pianos and radio-sets in
my country road, so with all manner of
artificial things, with the whole divisible
product of the machine, in every road,
every street, every market of the world.
How to produce enough is no longer any
problem at all. How to sell what is increasingly
produced—that is the problem.
Evidence thereof is the commonest thing
we see. It is painted in the landscape. It
illuminates the cities at night. It is in our
marginal vision when we read. There is
no lifting one’s eyes to heaven, no casting
them down in shame, no seeing whatever
without seeing it.</p>

<p>Each day a forest is cut down and consumed
for wood-pulp to make the paper
on which producers advertize their wares.
The use of advertizing is to stimulate in
people a sense of wanting. Selling is a
high profession to which men are trained
in special schools. To exchange goods for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
money over a counter, to higgle with the
individual buyer—that is not selling.
Clerks and peddlers do that. Selling is to
create new ways of wanting, new habits
of comfort and luxury, new customs of
having. This is done by agitating the
mass-imagination with the suggestive
power of advertizing. Business reserves
its most dazzling rewards for one who can
think of a way to make thousands, millions,
whole races of people want that thing to-day
which they knew not the lack of
yesterday.</p>

<p>Why is this so? Because there is never
enough wanting.</p>

<p>And why is there never enough wanting?
Because the divisible product of the
machine tends to increase faster than
wanting.</p>

<p>What advertizing cannot accomplish
governments may undertake. There are
backward, inert, idle races that do not
want much. They are content to do with
little. It becomes therefore the diplomatic
and military business of the powerful
industrial governments to change the ways
of such races. They must be brought forward,
modernized, electrified, taught how
to want more. Why? In order that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
shall be able to consume their quota of the
machine’s divisible product. Plenty shall
be put upon them.</p>

<p>There is no limit to that blessing. Those
who have it are anxious to share it, must
share it in fact, in order to keep it for
themselves, under the principle that the
cheapness of things is in proportion to the
quantity produced. The more the cheaper;
the fewer the dearer.</p>

<p>Are you beginning to suppose that man
has found what he sought? Since in this
extraordinary manner he appears to have
provided himself with plenty, shall that
dusty bundle of prayers be recalled or sent
to the furnace?</p>

<p>As to his prayers, they were never frank.
Perhaps for that reason he should wish he
had them back. He prayed for plenty;
what he secretly associated with the
thought of plenty was leisure—freedom
from toil. And once more he is disappointed,
thwarted by his own inventions.
Plenty he has achieved. Toil he has not
escaped.</p>

<p>The machine that was to have been a
labour-saving device becomes an engine of
production that must be served. It is as if
you could not save labour at all—as if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
could make it only more productive,
thereby achieving an abundance of things
with no effect whatever upon the necessity
to perform monotonous labour. All this
labour-saving machinery we live with notwithstanding,
never were people more complaining
of their tasks. That might mean
only that they were increasingly conscious
of an abating evil; but there is no certainty
that the abatement even where it is
noticeable is permanent. The signs are
otherwise.</p>

<p>In all material respects people are better
off than ever before. Their bodies are
more comfortable, their minds are free
from the terror of hunger, they have much
more to enjoy and consume and hope for,
because their labour is more richly
rewarded in things. See the amazing
quantity and variety of things such as only
the rich could once afford now circulating
at the base of the human pyramid. Not
necessaries only. Silks, watches, ornaments,
shoes like those of queens and ladies,
plated ware, upholstered furniture, soft
beds, besides things that were formerly
non-existent and therefore beyond the
reach of kings, sultans and nabobs, such as
electric lights, plumbing, motor-cars. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the United States a motor-car to every six
persons! And still no sign that the curve of
human contentment is rising; no sign that
the curse of toil will ever be got rid of.</p>

<p>Instead of saving labour the machine has
multiplied it. True, the hours of industrial
labour are fewer than they were, e.g.
now eight where they were ten and twelve
a day; but this is merely to compare worse
with better where better is, and that is not
everywhere. For a proper contrast compare
the industrial with the idyllic task.
Even eight hours of labour a day continuously
performed by the industrial worker
represents a much greater sum of annual
effort than his ancestor put into the soil.
Consider also how the machine, directly
or indirectly, has laid new work upon
races hitherto naively existing in a state
of nature.</p>

<p>The riddle is that industrial civilization,
having created to its unknown ends
a race of mechanical drudges, requires
nevertheless a contribution of human toil
more intense, more exacting, more irksome
than ever. As toil it is more productive—there
is more to consume. Life has been
expanded. It is safer. Physically it is
inconceivably richer. Was that the goal?
What else is gained?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>You would think that when man had
found a way to provide himself with artificial
things in unlimited plenty and a way
at the same time to spread the food supply
evenly over the face of the earth, the gift
of universal peace might follow. Never
was the peace more frail; and this, as we
shall see—the frailty of the peace—is also
a product of the machine.</p>

<p>What force is this by fumbling found
that man has put in motion? Its pulsations
he controls; its consequences so
far have controlled him, and modern life
has become so involved in a mechanical
spiral that we cannot say for certain
whether it is that we produce for the sake of
consumption or consume for the sake of
production.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MACHINE AS IF</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Either</span> the machine has a meaning to
life that we have not yet been able to
interpret in a rational manner or it is itself
a manifestation of life and therefore
mysterious. We have seen it grow. We
know it to be the exterior reality of our
own ideas. Thus we are very familiar
with it, as with our arms and legs, and see
it in much the same way—that is to say,
imperfectly and in some aspects not at all.
Certainly it would look very different if
for a moment we could see it from an
original point of view with the eye of new
wonder.</p>

<p>Fancy yourself a planetary tourist come
visiting here, knowing beforehand neither
God nor man, unable therefore to distinguish
intuitively between their works.</p>

<p>Would you not think the machine that
spins silk threads by the ton from cellulose
more wonderful than the silkworm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
similarly converting the mulberry leaf in
precious quantities, or a steel ship more
amazing than a whale? What of the
mechanical beast with a colorless fluid in
its tail and a flame in its nose that runs
sixty miles an hour without weariness?
Would it not seem superior in many ways
to the horse that goes forty miles in a day
and falls down?</p>

<p>Suppose, moreover, that you know the
tongue of men and are able to ask them
questions. You ask particularly about the
automobile, which you have mentally compared
with the horse; whereupon they
take you to the factories in Detroit to see
the automobile in process of becoming,
under conditions of mass-production, two
or three taking life with a snort every
minute. In this factory, they tell you, they
make only one hundred a day, very fine
ones; but in another they make five hundred,
and in another five thousand a day.</p>

<p>You ask them who makes the horse.</p>

<p>They do not know. They teach their
children to say God makes it. The horse
is a natural thing.</p>

<p>Then the automobile is an unnatural
thing?</p>

<p>They say no, smiling a little. Not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
unnatural thing. The automobile is a
mechanical thing because they make it
themselves.</p>

<p>You ask them why they say they
make it.</p>

<p>At this they are distressed. There has
been some slip of understanding in the use
of language. They explain it carefully.
The horse is born. There is no horse-factory.
The automobile is made, as you
have seen, in factories.</p>

<p>Still it is not explained. You argue it
with them. What is it they do in the
factory? They perform certain acts in
relation to automobiles. These, of course,
are necessary, vital acts. If they were not
performed, automobiles could not be. And
yet, how does this prove they make
automobiles? You ask them.</p>

<p>They ask you to say what else it could
prove.</p>

<p>You may say it proves only that they
are fathers of automobiles; and, since they
seem mystified greatly by this answer, you
remind them that in relation to their own
children also they perform certain vital
acts, essential to beget them and without
which children could not be, yet they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
never heard to say they make children.
They say children are born.</p>

<p>This has to be left as it is. Further
explanations lead to worse confusion.</p>

<p>You ask them certain other questions.
How long have they been on the earth—themselves?
How long have they had
machines? What did they do before they
had machines?</p>

<p>By their replies certain facts are established
in your mind, and from these facts
you make certain deductions, all clear
enough to you but incomprehensible to
them.</p>

<p>The facts are as follows: People have
been here on the earth a very long time,
millions of years they think. Machines
they have had for only a very short time,
or, as you now see them, for only two generations.
Before they had machines nearly
everyone tilled the soil. There was no
industry save handicraft. In the space of
one hundred years these conditions have so
remarkably changed that now only half
the people are required to till the soil; the
other half live by industry. This does not
mean what you thought at first; it does
not mean that half the fields have been
abandoned so that half the people might go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
into industry. You are careful to get this
straight, for it is very important. On
the contrary, since machines appeared
whole new continents of land have been
opened to cultivation. This was necessary
in order to feed the industrial workers who
live in cities, far off from fields, and buy
their food, whereas formerly everyone
generally speaking produced his own food,
even the people of what once were called
cities going forth seasonally to till and reap
the earth. Actually, the number of people
engaged in agriculture has greatly increased;
yet it is only half the population
where before it was the whole of it. What
does this mean? It means that since the
advent of machines the human race has
enormously increased in number; it has so
increased that the half of it which now is
agricultural is greater than the whole of it
was before. The new, non-agricultural
half is the industrial part: it is the part
that serves machines.</p>

<p>This fact is so astonishing that you wish
to verify it. You ask them what would
happen if all the machines in the world
should vanish suddenly away. Their
answer is that half the people living would
perish in a week. And that is what you
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>What may you deduce from these facts?</p>

<p>First, you will be amused that people are
so naïve as to think they make machines.
Then you may say there are two kinds of
people here, agricultural and industrial.
The earth makes one kind; machines make
the other. And you will feel as sure of
this as if you had proved it to your senses
when you have looked at a typical industrial
city where people live densely in compacted
habitations with no visible errand
on earth but to run to and fro tending the
machines that hum night and day in the
factories. Those tall, cylindrical, erupting
forms called smokestacks will appear
to you as generative symbols. If they were
not there, neither would the people be
there. Not only would the people not be
there. They would be nowhere. They
could never have existed. If the
smokestacks disappeared, so would all
these people, the industrial part of the
population, leaving only the agricultural
part—the part belonging to the soil—as it
was before.</p>

<p>As a planetary tourist, you may be at
least as certain these thoughts are true as
men are that they are untrue; and even if
they were true that would make no difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
really. The problems are practical.
We must think of machines as machines
act, logically.</p>

<p>One difficulty is that whereas the
machine is automatically, unerringly
logical, and nothing else, man has only a
little logic; he has, besides, emotions,
sentiments, instincts. In his unlogical
character he has often opposed himself
to the machine, meaning to destroy it.
At the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, the first railroad in
Great Britain and the first in the world, the
anti-machine feeling of British craftsmen
was dramatically symbolized by a lone
weaver seated at a loom on a high hill.
England was the industrial machine’s
first habitat on earth. There fanatical
men led mobs against it.</p>

<p>Frail and clumsy as it was at first, its
life was indestructible. And now man
would not dare destroy it if he could.
His own life is bound up with it. Steadily
it has grown more powerful, more productive,
more ominous. It has powers of
reproduction and variation which, if not
inherent, are yet as if governed by an
active biological principle. Machines produce
machines. Besides those from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
we get the divisible product of artificial
things, there are machines to make
machines, and both kinds—(both the
machines that make machines and those
that transform raw materials into things
of use and desire)—obey some law of
evolution.</p>

<p>Compare any kind of machine you may
happen to think of with what its ancestor
was only twenty-five years ago. Its efficiency
has doubled, trebled; its shape has
changed; and, as it is in the animal kingdom
so too with machines, suddenly
a new species appears, a sport, a freak, with
no visible ancestor.</p>

<p>Man’s sense of material power within
his environment has increased proportionately.
It is colossal. Benefits such as
formerly he would have thought beyond
supernatural agency if he could have
imagined them at all he now confers upon
himself. More without end presents only
technical difficulties. No physical circumstance
forbids him. Nevertheless the fact,
and only the more strange it is, that for
reasons which he names economic or political
he seems powerless to inform the augmenting
body of machine phenomena with
a rational or benign spirit.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br>
<span class="fs70">THE LAW OF MACHINES</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> longer do we speak of machines.
They are too numerous and too different.
We speak of industrial equipment, which
means machine-power in general.</p>

<p>As you may know, the industrial equipment
of the world is increasing by terrific
momentum. The machine is spreading
over the face of the earth like an idea
new truth. And this is so notwithstanding
the fact that the industrial equipment
already existing in the world is so great
that if for one year it were worked at ideal
capacity the product could not be sold for
enough to pay the wages of labour, to say
nothing of the cost of material, overhead
charges, or profit. Markets would be
glutted with goods. Producers would be
ruined.</p>

<p>It follows that the pressing anxiety of
industry is how to regulate and limit production
in order not to overwhelm its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
markets. Its chronic nightmare is overproduction,
meaning a quantity of
divisible products in excess of the immediate
sum of effective desire. Hence combines,
pools, rings, cartels, committees,
and associations of manufacturers, which
the courts are powerless to prevent even
where they are forbidden by law. These
are a vital measure of mutual preservation.
Yet they are but protocols of truce. They
very soon break down and have to be made
all over again.</p>

<p>Control of production, save here and
there for a little while, is a myth. It
could be managed only in case there was a
monopoly of machine-power. Once there
was. There is no longer, and never will
be again. Industrial production, taking
it broadly, increases in an uncontrollable
manner.</p>

<p>The evidence is notorious, first in the
efforts of national industry to increase the
sale of goods in its own country, and then
in the strife among industrial nations for
access to foreign markets.</p>

<p>A steam calliope jamming its way
through the crowded street of New York
City to advertize a new model of a popular
motor-car at a reduced price is a spectacle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
to bear reflection. It is a symptom of
saturation in the home market. When
Henry Ford was making only a thousand
cars a day, he did not advertize. There
was a ready cash-demand for the whole
of his product. When his output passed
five thousand cars a day, he began to
advertize on billboards and to sell on the
instalment plan.</p>

<p>As the natural cash-demand for a thing
is overtaken, it begins to be pressed for
sale on credit. At this point finance steps
in. Credit companies with millions of
capital are formed expressly for the purpose
of lending buyers the money with
which to buy. Desire shall be made effective.
Selling on credit in this manner has
latterly and suddenly assumed such proportions
as to represent in the affair of
business a new pattern. Some old-fashioned
minds have been debating it as
an evil. They attack it on the ground that
it betrays the virtue of thrift. But thrift
has ceased to be a virtue. To consume—to
consume more and more progressively—to
be able to say in the evening “I
have consumed more to-day than I consumed
yesterday”, this now is a duty the
individual owes to industrial society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>For see what would happen if people all
over the world should return of a sudden
to the former ways of thrift—to the habit
of doing without? There would be
depression in industry. Machines would
stop. Millions who tend them would be
disemployed. Nothing would be safe, not
even your own money, for there would be
panic on the exchange and trouble at the
bank.</p>

<p>One is not speaking of the United
States alone. The multiplication of things
is greater here than anywhere else because
we make machines faster and work them
harder; but you will find the same necessity
acting also in France, the very cradle
of thrift, where now cheap motors are
sold on credit: anyone who will buy may
borrow the money to buy with. Why is
this in France? To stimulate the motor
habit? To serve a private profit-motive?
The habit will follow; the profit may.
But there is another reason, touching
foreign trade, which we are coming to
elucidate.</p>

<p>In order to sell abroad, an industrial
nation must be able to produce cheaply.
To produce cheaply, it must produce in
large quantities by a multiple method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
called mass-production. And you can
safely manage this mass-production only
provided you have a fairly large and constant
base of domestic demand. So the
sale of French motor-cars in France,
though it be on credit, must be large
enough to support the method of mass-production,
for otherwise France would be
unable to meet the competition of Ford,
who now exports motor-cars to Europe—even
builds them there. Then the British
manufacturers, to meet the competition of
both France and Ford, also undertake
against their genius to produce motor-cars
by the quantity method, and, having
achieved the method, their next dilemma is
what to do with the product. They
advertize at home to create a popular
motor-car habit and at the same time
press their cars for sale in foreign markets,
even in France and Germany, as these
countries press theirs for sale in Great
Britain.</p>

<p>Competition among industrial nations to
exploit one another’s internal markets is
but one profile of all that dangerous
activity taking place in the name of foreign
trade. The industrial powers holding their
feet in China’s doorway and France fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the native in Morocco are other aspects
of the same thing. China so long as
possible shall be an open market for the
surplus product of western machines;
there shall be more wanting in Morocco.</p>

<p>The industrial equipment of the world
meanwhile goes on increasing, though it is
already so great that its capacity cannot be
fully utilized. In the United States alone
there is probably enough surplus machine-capacity
to satisfy the whole demand of
Great Britain’s foreign customers for
staple merchandise, such as textiles, iron
and steel manufacturers, rubber tires,
motor-cars, electrical apparatus, machinery,
glass, garments, shoes, cutlery, and so
on. Great Britain not only has a surplus
of machine-power; she has besides an
excess of man-power represented by say
one and one-quarter millions unemployed.
She could easily take on the entire foreign
trade of France; but in France also there
is a surplus of machine-power. Both
Great Britain and France dread the competition
of Germany, whose production of
goods with her existing equipment could
be increased, under incentive, nobody
knows how much.</p>

<p>The exterior facts do not make sense.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
They represent industry to be witless, in
that, while dreading surplus as the evil
that devoureth profit, it is at the same time
bent to push supply to a point beyond saturation.
Industry does not do this. Necessity
does it. There is an interior fact.
The tendency of the divisible product of
machines to exceed the sum of effective
desire is the last thing that industry wishes
for. It is owing to a principle hitherto
mentioned, namely, the principle that the
cheapness of things is in proportion to the
quantity produced. Which now is to be
explained.</p>

<p>It is the economic function of the
machine to cheapen production. There is
otherwise no point to it. But, if we
say things are more cheaply made by
machine than by hand, we speak very
loosely. What we mean is that a quantity
of things is more cheaply made by machine
than by hand.</p>

<p>For example, the cost of a single yard
of cloth produced by machine is hundreds
of times greater than the cost of a
single yard of it produced by hand.
Obviously, the power-loom is a very costly
piece of machinery to build, and so is
the engine that drives it. If you produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
on a power-loom only the amount of cloth
a weaver could make by hand, nobody
could afford to buy it. But when you
produce on the power-loom a quantity of
cloth one hundred times greater than a
weaver can make by hand, then, of course
it is much cheaper. And the more you
produce the cheaper it is. So with anything.
The greater the quantity, the lower
the cost. Hence the terms quantity, or
mass-production, meaning, first, to
standardize the product, as to make it all
black, all one texture, all one width or
shape, and then to bring a chain of
machine-power continuously to bear upon
its multiple production.</p>

<p>Observe the working of this principle.
Take watches. At one time they were
made by hand, slowly, laboriously, in
stances being not uncommon of a craftsman
spending half his lifetime to make a
very fine one. Under these conditions
watches are rare and costly. Only the
very rich can buy them. Suddenly they
began to be made by machines. A very
good watch can be made for fifty dollars.
There are a million people who want
watches at that price. This is an original
demand, a kind of vacuum, represented by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
a million people who have never had
watches and now for the first time may
possess them. Watches cannot be made
fast enough to meet this want. The
industry, for that reason, expands very
fast. Then all at once the demand is
satisfied. The million have watches. The
vacuum has been filled. Hereafter the
demand will tend to be static: it will
increase slowly as the population increases
or as people in general grow richer, little by
little. The watch-making industry, therefore,
is depressed. It has to limit production.
Now comes someone with the idea
that by carrying the machine method
further a watch can be made for ten dollars.
There are twenty million people who can
afford to buy watches at that price. The
ten-dollar watch appears. The demand
again is like a vacuum, twenty times
greater than the first. For a while ten-dollar
watches cannot be made fast enough.
The makers of fifty-dollar watches throw
away their old machines, install new ones,
increase their production, reduce their
costs, and not only make what was a fifty
dollar watch for twenty-five but contribute
also, in a competitive manner, to the
supply of ten-dollar watches. Suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
what happened before happens again. The
twenty million have watches. The vacuum
is filled. Then someone says: “But there
are one hundred million who would buy
watches at two dollars”. So the process is
repeated, still lower in the pyramid. The
two-dollar watch is not a fine watch, but
it will keep time; and as you would know,
with the improvement that has taken place
in machine practice the cost of making any
kind of watch, even the finest, has been
greatly reduced. A watch ceases to be a
luxury or a token of caste. It is a necessary
part of man’s personal equipment, all
the way down to the base of the pyramid.</p>

<p>There you have the cycle. The use of
the machine is to cheapen the cost of
production. The sign is quantity. When
the supply at a given price has overtaken
the effective demand you have either to
idle your machinery, in which case your
cost of production will rise, or open a wider
demand at a lower price. To lower the
price and keep a profit you have to cheapen
the cost of production still more. This
you can do only by increasing the quantity,
which again overtakes the demand, creating
again the same necessity to cheapen the
cost by increasing the quantity in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
be able to make a lower price for greater
demand. Thus supply pursues demand,
downward through the social structure.</p>

<p>There is at last a base to the pyramid—its
very widest point. When that is
reached—what? Well, then you need
bazaars in a foreign sun, heathen races of
your own to train up in the way of wanting
the products of your machines, new
worlds of demand. You turn to foreign
trade. And if you are an aggressive country
that has come late to this business, as
Germany was, and find that most of the
promising heathen races are already
adopted and that all the best bazaar-sites
are taken, you may easily work yourself
into a panic of fear and become a menace to
the peace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br>
<span class="fs70">WHO MIND THEM OR STARVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is it you will fear? That you
will be unable to sell away the surplus
product of your machines? That industry
will be unable to make a profit?</p>

<p>No. The fear is that you will starve.
Your machines have called into existence
millions of people who otherwise would
not have been born—at least, not there in
that manner. These millions who mind
machines are gathered in cities. They
produce no food. They produce with
their machines artificial things that are
exchanged for food. It is usually the case,
too, that they have to buy the raw materials
on which their machines act, as Great
Britain buys raw cotton from the United
States and Egypt, and wool from Australia,
to feed her great textile industries; having
manufactured this material, she sends it
forth again as cloth, to be exchanged for
wheat in Canada or beef in South America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>As you begin with machines your population
divides. It becomes part rural and
part industrial, and so long as the rural
part of it can feed the industrial part
there is no trouble. But a time soon comes
when the need of the industrial workers
for sustenance is greater than the native
production of food. This time inevitably
comes because the machines call up people
so rapidly. Then you have to look abroad
for food. That means you have to go into
other countries—peasant-countries—where
there is a surplus of meat and grain,
and exchange there your manufactured
goods for food. And you begin to think
and speak of your economic necessity.</p>

<p>There is no such necessity really. To
assert it is to say a preposterous thing,
namely, that when your industrial population
has increased beyond the native food-supply,
to a point at which you are out of
balance, you are obliged to import food so
that your industrial population may continue
to increase and your cities to grow
and your necessity to become greater and
greater in an endless spiral.</p>

<p>It cannot be endless. One of two things
will determine the sequel. Either
presently the resources of those peasant-nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
that produce a surplus of food will
be exhausted or they will in time think to
become industrial nations, too, and eat
their own surplus. There is no lucid reason
why a population should not disperse as it
begins to exceed the native food-supply—that
is to say, migrate to the sources of
food.</p>

<p>In this new political dogma of an absolute
economic necessity to import food and
raw materials in exchange for manufactures
the ancient myth-wish reappears.
The machine does not abolish the curse of
toil. It was not the escape men sought.
But it does create a preferred task.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the peasant-task has been
despised: it bore the curse direct. And,
when the machine made it possible for
many to embrace instead what was deemed
the lesser affliction of industrial labour
gregariously performed in cities, the
impulse thereto was headlong.</p>

<p>Hence the rise of that angular
phenomenon called the industrial nation—a
nation able to buy its food, therefore
delivered from the fate of peasantry and
for that reason entitled to consider itself
of higher caste than agricultural nations.</p>

<p>Hence the tumescent city as one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
most alarming appearances of our time.</p>

<p>Hence, also, that idea of economic
necessity, which, getting control of the
political mind of Europe, inevitably
involved the world in a machine-war.
What made that war so terrifying, so
destructive, so extensive, was the power of
the machine—an inconceivable power
except as it disclosed itself from day to day.
No one beholding the event from a firmamental
point of view could have supposed
it was a war between races of men. Man in
contrast with the machines he served was
pitifully insignificant.</p>

<p>In Germany the task of bending the
country’s industrial equipment to the uses
of war was assigned to a man who possessed
one of the very brilliant Jewish minds
in the world. In him were combined the
three high characteristics of his race, which
are loyalty, intellectual realism, and
dreaming imagination. His practical job
was more complex than that of the Chief of
Staff. Yet his mind was not wholly
occupied with this care. His critical faculties
and his imagination were always free.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the economic meaning of
the war, he was led to examine the essential
character of international trade, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
perceived clearly how wasteful, preposterous,
and dangerous a great deal of it
was—Germany pressing the surplus product
of her machines for sale in Great
Britain, the British doing likewise in
Germany, both competing at home and
abroad with the industrial surplus of the
United States, ships passing on the seas
with cargoes of similar goods endlessly
duplicated, and all the machine-craft
nations seeking peasant-nations to be
exploited for food in exchange for manufactures.
It was true in this way the world
had been growing richer in things, and yet
the cost was frightful. The resort to force
was a confession that international trade
was bankrupt in reason and understanding.</p>

<p>He was competent to reach a conclusion
standing himself at the head of one of
Europe’s great industries. And he made a
dream. It was that, when the war had
come to an end and people were themselves
again, they would see the vital importance
to civilization of dividing among them
the work of the world agreeably to their
special aptitudes and the facts of environment—those
to produce a surplus of
whatever it was they had a genius for
making and the materials ready; these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
others another kind of thing in which their
skill and situation gave them an advantage;
and so on through the whole series of
natural and artificial things with which
human wants are satisfied. Thus duplication
and strife would be eliminated. Not
only would there be enough of everything:
from the elimination of senseless waste in
private and public war there would be a
saving of power and capital sufficient to
water all the deserts of the earth and
recreate man’s vistas here.</p>

<p>As a dream, it was most alluring. As a
plan it was worthless, for it contained two
fatal assumptions, namely, that you could
always find a Solomon to administer it and
that people would submit to the benevolent
tyranny of his wisdom. He himself was
destined by his end to illustrate how people
really behave. Shortly after the close of
the war he was murdered in the name of
fanatic nationalism.</p>

<p>It was a sign.</p>

<p>The war released a flood of repressed
passions in nationalism. Great and small
groups of submerged people asserted rights
of self-determination and clothed themselves
with frontiers and nationhood.
Nearly all of these, together also with old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
countries whose character until then had
been agricultural, were concurrently seized
with the thought of economic independence—that
is to say, with the thought of
having machines and industries of their
own, for they had seen a new thing.
Industrial nations and none other were
powerful in the world. Nations without
machines were helpless, subject, in fact, to
those that had them.</p>

<p>Enormously stimulated in its function
of reproduction by the onset of this human
idea, the machine broke bounds. No one
now has any control of it.</p>

<p>Only a few years ago Great Britain
alone controlled it. She had a monopoly
of its power and use by right of having
been the first to develop it, and she was
for a while the only nation having a large
surplus of manufactures to sell in foreign
countries. Then came Germany, France,
and Belgium. Of these Germany was
Great Britain’s most aggressive rival,
making nearly all of the same things and
most of them cheaper. After 1870 the
United States developed industry very fast
but for twenty years more her exports
were principally agricultural because she
herself consumed the entire product of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
machines, besides importing manufactured
goods from Europe in exchange for meat
and grain and raw cotton. It was not
until about 1890 that American machine-products
began to invade the markets of
the world in a large way. And at about
the same time Japan appeared as an industrial
nation, having in a few years equipped
herself with Western machines and
trained her imitative hand to mind them.</p>

<p>Such, roughly, was the economic state
of the world at the outbreak of the War.
The powerfully industrialized nations were
four in Europe, counting little Belgium;
one in the West; and one in the East—six
altogether, representing hardly more than
one-fifth of the world’s total population.</p>

<p>If we regard only the countries where
the industrial population had so outrun
the native food-supply that the sale of
manufactures in foreign lands to pay for
food had either become, or was believed to
be, a vital transaction, then we count out
the United States. This country is still
self-nourished. That leaves only five, and
the competition among these five for markets,
for colonies, and heathen tribes to be
instructed in wanting, for private pathways
by land and sea to the sources of food, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
access to the raw materials required by
their machines, was already desperate and
dangerous. Between two of them it was
deadly.</p>

<p>Even then it was so. Since then the
machine has multiplied tremendously
where its habitat was and has gone migrating,
besides, all over the earth.</p>

<p>In those six countries that were already
intensively industrialized what appears?
Their machine equipment has greatly
increased. During the War it increased for
obvious reasons. God was on the side of
the most machines. Since the War it has
continued to increase for other reasons.
One reason was peculiar to Germany.
There the building of furnaces, factories,
and machine-works by a dynastic method,
as the pyramids were built, without credit
or gold, simply by command of the industrialists
over labour and material, was a
way of baffling the Allied creditors.
Another reason was peculiar to France.
Restoring the industries of the devastated
regions meant building them a second time,
since they had been already once reproduced
elsewhere in France during the War.
But the reason over all lay in that fixed
idea of economic necessity, not changed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the least by anything that had happened,
only now more desperate than ever, owing
both to the intensified competition of the
older countries among themselves and to
the spread of the machine into other
countries.</p>

<p>How the competition among themselves
has been intensified may be illustrated in
the case of textiles as between Great
Britain and France. Before the War both
imported raw cotton and exported fabrications
of cotton; but, whereas Great
Britain exported principally the cotton
cloth of universal commerce, France
exported special products representing her
genius for style and artistry. Now, however,
having made large additions to her
general textile equipment, France feels
obliged to compete directly with Great
Britain in cotton-cloth of common commerce.
To do this she must extend her
foreign trade parallel to Great Britain’s
and divide the markets hitherto dominated
by the British. As with cotton-cloth, so
with other manufactures, particularly
those of iron and steel, wherein France
proposes to compete and is equipped to
compete with both Germany and Great
Britain as never before. Each step she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
takes in this direction augments her economic
necessity, for now almost the last thing
you would expect to see in France is taking
place. The native population as a whole is
static, but its character is changing. The
industrial part of it is growing; the
agricultural part is waning. People are
deserting the fields to embrace industrial
life—to mind machines. In every city
there is a housing problem; public credit is
employed to build small dwellings for the
wage-earners; yet in the country, two
hours from Paris, you will see houses empty
and going to ruin, whole rural villages in
the way to be abandoned, vineyards perishing
for want of care, fields going to grass
instead of grain. Their industrial power is
rising; their agricultural power is falling.
Before the War they were, or might have
been, self-nourishing on their own soil like
the people of the United States. That
precious security they cast away. In place
of it they take on the anxieties of empire.
They must impose upon Morocco the blessings
of European civilization in order to
have an outlet there for the surplus of
their machines.</p>

<p>Dramatic are the migrations of the
machine and not unlike the migrations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
natural species, men and beasts, in search
of food. The machine seeks either cheaper
raw material or people to mind its processes.</p>

<p>There is Italy, with a population greater
than that of France, growing half-a-million
a year. It is the most fecund race in
Europe. Suddenly the Italians wake up
and are resolved upon an industrial career.
Before the War this thought was dim
among them. In the crisis it took shape.
Since the War it has become an
enthusiasm, and now smoke-towers are
rising very fast. Definitely they have
turned their minds from agriculture to
industry, not merely in order that they
may become self-supplied with manufactures
instead of buying them from other
countries with lemons and olive oil, but in
order to grow rich and powerful in foreign
trade. They propose hereafter and
progressively to exchange machine-wares
for food. Italy will be a formidable rival
for Great Britain, Germany, France, and
Belgium, who are already beginning to
feel it.</p>

<p>Poland perceives her destiny to be
industrial: she has already a large surplus
of manufactured goods to sell. Likewise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Czechoslovakia. These are instances of
new countries. Spain and Greece are
importing machinery, and Spain is so
anxious to develop industry that she considers
paying a bounty out of the public
treasury on exports of textiles. India,
whose historic economic function had been
to send raw cotton to Great Britain and buy
cotton cloth from Manchester, now consumes
half her own raw cotton in her native
mills; she not only satisfies three-quarters
of her own want for cotton cloth but is
beginning actually to export that commodity,
even to the United States. This
will seem very wasteful, indeed, when you
pause to set it against the historical background
of the United States. For a long
time we exported raw cotton and imported
cotton cloth. That was to have been the
pattern of our economic life as a British
colony; we were to produce only raw
materials, ship them to Great Britain and
buy from her the surplus of her machines.
We were forbidden, in fact, to weave
cloth for sale or to have iron mills. Now
we are an industrial nation; we consume
more and more of our own raw cotton and
export enormous quantities of cotton cloth.
Ultimately we shall have no raw cotton at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
all to sell; our mills will require the whole
of our annual crop; we shall have nothing
but cotton cloth to sell. To whom shall
we sell it? Not to the Indians; they wish
to make their own. Probably not to the
Egyptians. The Japanese manufacturers
of cotton goods have recently invaded the
Egyptian market that was formerly Great
Britain’s own, and are underselling the
British there. You would think China
would be Japan’s natural outlet for cotton
goods. So it is. The difficulty is that
Japan must be looking further because
China is beginning to supply herself.</p>

<p>The Chinese instance is poignant. A
few years ago—until the War, in fact—China
exported food and raw materials
and imported manufactured goods—nothing
else to speak of either way. This was
as the Western industrial nations wished it
to be. So anxious were they to have it so
that they bound China by treaty not to put
tariff barriers against the goods they
wished to sell in the Chinese markets,
except by mutual consent—that is to say,
with their consent.</p>

<p>The War suspended this thraldom. The
Chinese imported machines and began to
make their own things, especially cloth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Power-looms appeared as by magic. And
after the War, they continued to appear.
During three years after the War the number
trebled, and in 1922, the table of
Chinese imports and exports presented a
strange face. Among her imports were
machines and machine-parts; also semimanufactured
goods to be finished in
Chinese factories. And one-fifth of her
total exports consisted of manufactured
goods. China an exporter of machine
products!</p>

<p>And so up and down the earth. In
Brazil, where there was hardly any visible
production of artificial things before 1914,
the whole outlook has changed. That
country is now able from her own machines
to meet the whole of her want for matches,
textiles, footgear, wallpaper, phonograph-discs,
hardware, hats, and playing cards,
and will soon be self-supplied with
practically everything she needs.</p>

<p>The Colonial System that was to have
answered forever Great Britain’s need for
raw materials and food in exchange for
machine-products will not hold in that
character. In India the revolt is political;
elsewhere it is peaceably economic. Canada
is already powerfully machined; she is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
exporting motor-cars. Australia, going in
the same direction, is beginning to export
shoes. The Union of South Africa takes
steps to subsidize local industry. Ireland
no sooner gains control of her economic
life than she puts a tariff-wall around herself
to limit the sale of foreign goods,
meaning British goods as well, thinking
thereby to foster infant industries.</p>

<p>Well, everyone now is doing that. The
old industrial countries, too, are protecting
themselves against one another’s goods,
the last to come to it being Great Britain
herself. For more than half-a-century she
was the protagonist of free trade, abhoring
tariffs, because she was paramount in
machine-craft and could beat her rivals
both in their own markets and in her own.
That advantage having departed from her,
she is driven to tariff-protection: she puts
up barriers against other people’s goods if
they are too cheap, because they are too
cheap, and calls it Safeguarding Home
Industries.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PARADOX OF SURPLUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> does it mean? Can there be too
many desirable and useful things? Can
things be too cheap? You would say No.
Surely, so long as any human want remains
unsatisfied, things cannot be either too
plentiful or too cheap? But there is
another dimension.</p>

<p>Everything that is not still or dead
must exist in a state of rhythmic tension.
It is true of the plant, it is true of the
animal, it is true of each race of plants
and each race of animals, it is true of the
kingdom of plants against the kingdom of
animals. It is true of people, as individuals,
as races, as a species. And it is true,
also, of the machine.</p>

<p>In the living organism growth of tissue
at a normal rate consonant with the
rhythm is vital. A wild growth of that
same tissue will be fatal. In the aggregate
of life there is equilibrium among millions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
of different forms, each form striving but
never succeeding and is possessing every
other form and taking the world. The oyster,
if unhindered, would displace every other
living thing on the earth in maybe ten
generations, and then, of course, perish for
want of space in which to contain itself.
What hinders the oyster and at the same
time preserves it is that principle of tension
in nature, without which it would be
impossible for innumerable forms and
varieties of life, the relations of which to
one another are reciprocal, neutral, hostile,
anonymous, to exist together all in one
great taut pattern.</p>

<p>Now regard the third kingdom, artificial,
implanted with mechanical beasts, that
contains civilization. Life in this environment
is economic. Its characteristic
behaviour is a progressive differentiation of
labour. Tasks are divided and subdivided
until, at length, there are countless
separate groups of people, each one
performing a singular function to which it
is trained and tending to become unable
to perform any other. The subdivisions
are beyond enumeration. They multiply
so fast that the book of the census cannot
keep up with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The shoe-industry, for example, does
not consist in shoemakers. You might
search it in vain for a shoemaker—that is,
one who should know how to raise a pair
of shoes from flat leather. In the shoe
factory the material passes through a train
of machines. Each machine is minded by
an operative who performs one little
specialized part of the work in endless
repetition. The product is shoes by
thousands of gross.</p>

<p>But who determines what kinds of shoe
and how many shoes shall be made? What
becomes of them when they are made?
Who knows they can be sold? What if
they are not saleable?</p>

<p>If you address these questions to one of
the operatives minding a machine you will
find him dumb. He knows only his own
function.</p>

<p>It is very complicated. There are two
industries here. One is the shoe-industry;
the other is the shoe-machine industry.
One could not exist without the other, yet
they are separate and very unlike. The
shoe-industry itself, that has dispensed
with shoemakers, will have a finance
department, an economic department, a
buying department, a department of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
production science, a style and designing
department, a chemical department, a
department of distribution, a sales department,
an advertizing department, and
others we do not think of. It is all about
shoes. These are all shoe people. They
agglomerate in shoe towns. They think
shoes. The world is a foot. The more it
can be shod the better. They live by shoes.</p>

<p>But to do this they must be able to
exchange shoes for the things they want.
Shoes, therefore, must have a relation of
value to every other thing in the economic
world. It follows that, in order to have
this exchange-value, shoes must have also
a relation of quantity to all other things.
If for any reason the production of shoes
becomes suddenly abnormal that
exchange-value is lost. It is like one kind
of tissue growing wild in the organism.
Shoes are necessary; but an excessive
quantity cannot be absorbed by the
economic body. There will be in that case
a morbid pathology in the shoe-industry,
unemployment in the shoe town, despair
among the shoe people, many of whom
have never learned to do anything else.
Left to themselves, without shoes to make,
they might even starve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>It may be in the same way a soap town,
a textile town, a garment town, an iron
town, a motor town like Detroit, a rubber-tire
town like Akron, a furniture town like
Grand Rapids. It may be all of these—that
is to say, industry as a whole, increasing
its output at an abnormal rate. As you
project the thought you begin to see, first,
the vital importance of rhythm, equilibrium,
tension, in the realm of industry,
and then the inverse meaning of a sudden
competitive increase in the machine-power
of the world.</p>

<p>Ask the Italians what it means. They
are an old people coming to it with a fresh
mind. The conversation that follows took
place in February, 1925. Talking are, on
one side, the Italian Minister of Finance,
and on the other, a visiting journalist:</p>

<p>“The industrial idea is new in Italy. It
is since the War. You had a clean slate.
You could have done anything you had the
imagination to do. First you might have
made a scientific survey of Italy’s latent
genius and resources, and then you might
have thought of producing goods that
should be uniquely Italian and therefore
non-competitive. But what have you
done? You have gone in for the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
staples of world commerce, such as cotton
and woollen textiles, artificial silk, and
motor-cars. Don’t you see that in doing
this you take on the competition of Great
Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, the
United States?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we see that.”</p>

<p>“Those countries have the field and the
experience and better access than Italy to
sources of raw material.”</p>

<p>“That we know, also.”</p>

<p>“Then how can you hope successfully
to compete with them? What have you
that they have not? What advantage
against theirs?”</p>

<p>“One you haven’t thought of.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“A man can live on less in Italy than
anywhere else. We don’t know why that
is. It may be the way the sun shines on
him. But it is a fact. That is our advantage.
With that we shall succeed.”</p>

<p>“Do you realize what that means? You
are saying that Italy proposes to found an
industrial career on the lowest terms of
human existence. Your people will not
accept it.”</p>

<p>“But they will.”</p>

<p>“How do you know they will?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“Because they will do anything sooner
than starve.”</p>

<p>What a finish for the morning hope of
the machine-age!—if it were. Monotonous
tending of the machine on the lowest
standard of living; alternative, starvation.</p>

<p>Suppose it were true. Suppose the
Italian people did accept the terms and
acquired the knack and skill. Then Italian
manufactures, being cheaper than any
other, would sweep the markets of the
world. The older industrial nations—Great
Britain, Germany, France, the
United States, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al.</i>—could protect their
domestic markets by tariff-barriers, but
they would find themselves losing their
foreign markets to the Italians. For such
industrial countries as are obliged to
exchange a machine-surplus abroad for
food the loss of foreign markets would be
fatal. They would have to meet the Italian
competition. They would have to say, as
the Italians now are saying: “It is that or
starve.” They would have to let down the
standard of living to meet Italy’s wage-cost.
This would oblige Italy to make her
standard lower still, and thus, in a cycle,
until all of them were sunk in misery.</p>

<p>And this is by no means an impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
progression of events. It has once taken
place on a lesser scale. Beginning about
1870, there was a sudden and uncontrollable
increase in the output of industry from
two principal causes. One was the rapid
rise of competitive industry in Germany
and the United States; the other—much
more potent—was the discovery of a new
and cheaper way of making steel. This one
discovery transformed the aspect of
industry by increasing its potential power
as much, perhaps, as one-hundred fold.
Until then people spoke of the iron age;
after that it was the steel age. For
a quarter of a century prices fell continuously,
while solemn economic bodies sat
pondering the phenomenon. In that time
all the capital employed in industry was
lost at least once, probably twice or three
times. The producer’s only hope was to
improve his machines and increase production,
for as he did that his cost per unit fell
and for a little while he could undersell
his competitor. In methods of production
and in the efficiency of machines there
was necessarily amazing progress; nevertheless,
when all other means of reducing
costs had failed, it had to be taken out of
labour. In the United States it was not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
bad because here the domestic demand for
manufactures was unlimited, and a tariff-wall
protected industry from foreign competition.
In Germany it was very bad.</p>

<p>Germany then was where Italy now is.
Her advantage was that the German people
would work harder and longer for less
money than the British. The competition
was between these two. The British
Government, disturbed by her new rival’s
success in foreign trade, made a study of
labour conditions in Germany. It found
Sunday labour very prevalent in the factories.
“Only the hours of divine service
are excluded”, said a report from Saxony.</p>

<p>Commenting, <em>The</em> (London) <cite>Economist</cite>
said: “The question of Sunday labour is
one of considerable interest for England,
for it is unquestionable that among the
causes of Germany’s ability to compete
with England as a mercantile and
industrial country the fact that here more
hours are worked for less money is not the
least important. The prohibition of Sunday
labour would, of course, mean
increased cost of production, and every
increase in the cost of production will
render it more difficult for Germany to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
outrival older manufacturing countries in
the markets of the world.”</p>

<p>What might have happened does not
detain us. What did happen was very
fortunate.</p>

<p>First, the food-supply from free virgin
land in North and South America increased
at the same time in a prodigious manner, so
that, notwithstanding the wild energy of
the machine, the equilibrium between agriculture
and industry was fairly well
maintained.</p>

<p>Second, there was still room in the
world for colonial development on a vast
scale. This occurred, and the outlets
thereby created for the surplus product of
machines were most timely.</p>

<p>Third—and this is very important—finance,
to save itself from deluge, got
control of industry. It was unable to buy
industry out. All the banks in the world
had not money enough to do that. This
apparently insuperable difficulty it solved
in a simple manner. It formed industry
by groups into great joint-stock corporations
and sold the stock to the public.
And, although generally finance did not
keep control in a literal sense, it did so
centre it as to make the management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
responsive thereafter to financial counsel.
The classic instance in the United States
was the formation of the Steel Trust, which
was in very earnest a measure of desperation.
The steel-making machine had
become a demon whose pastime was panic.
By this feat of finance, which occurred in
all industrial countries, a new rhythm was
established. It was most imperfect:
absolute control of production was impossible.
But panics from overproduction
were thereafter episodic, not continuous,
and this was a great improvement.</p>

<p>And now a second time the machine has
got away. But how much more powerful
it is and widely planted than before.
The industrial capacity of the United
States alone is greater than that of all
Europe twenty-five years ago. There are
no more such virgin continents as North
and South America to be exploited for
food; and, besides, countries that were
then content to play an agricultural part,
exchanging meat and grain and raw
materials for machine-made wares, now are
resolved to have industries of their own—nay!
more, to have an industrial surplus
for sale abroad, engaging in that game
themselves. Colonies are no longer docile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
And as to finance, there is little probability
that it will be able again to lay its hand
upon the throttle. There are several
reasons why.</p>

<p>The significance of industry has changed.
Formerly it was a private affair in which
the State was but dimly concerned, and so
concerned only in a social sense, whereas
now the idea of industry is basically
political. It associates with thoughts of
security independence in all circumstances,
national welfare, power, and grandeur. A
factory is like a ship to be privately enjoyed
in time of peace, subject to mobilization
for war. The War did that. Great
Britain now subsidizes so-called key-industries
as before she subsidized ships
under the eye of the Admiralty if they
were so built as to be easily converted into
cruisers. All this is beyond the control of
finance.</p>

<p>For another reason, there are signs that
industry in the future is more likely to
command finance than finance is to
dominate industry.</p>

<p>By finance it shall be understood that
we mean organized influence—in short,
banking. Its occult authority has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
seriously impaired. The high day of its
priestcraft is gone.</p>

<p>Formerly it was consulted in war. You
could not manage a war without a gold-chest:
it was the banker who said whether
that could be filled or not. Now one of
the first steps you take in case of war is to
suspend the bank, declare a moratorium,
and print paper money to pass from hand
to hand.</p>

<p>When the World-War started it was the
opinion of finance that it could not last
above ninety days: it could not be
financed beyond that limit. It lasted four
years and did not stop then for want of
money.</p>

<p>After the War international finance was
morally powerless to prevent the colossal
mark swindle, Germany printing and selling
all over the earth billions of paper
marks that were to be flatly repudiated.
Nor was it able to visit the slightest
penalty upon the authors of this financial
enormity, for immediately afterwards it
was obliged, on political grounds, to float
a large gold loan for Germany and thereby
restore her to solvency and credit. In
Germany finance was unable to prevent
the industrial dynasts from appropriating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
to themselves all the middle-class wealth
that was invested in bonds, mortgages,
annuities, and savings banks: they simply
borrowed it and then paid it back in worthless
paper money.</p>

<p>It is very significant this humiliation of
finance. In situations where the political
will is dominant and in those where
economic forces act alone the omens are the
same. Henry Ford is the extraordinary
instance of an industrialist who proceeds
without benefit of finance. He creates his
capital as he goes along; what he does not
create he commands. He does not borrow.</p>

<span class="fs70">IN PERIL OF TRADE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> now what will happen? From the
excessive power already existing to produce
industrial commodities, from the
continued increase of that power nevertheless
for political and national reasons,
from the raising of trade-barriers by one
nation against another because every one
fears the effect upon its own industries of
receiving cheap goods from another, from
this running of people out of the fields to
tend more machines, from the amazing
growth of urban tissue in the economic
body—from all of this what follows?</p>

<p>The Italians suggest a bitter competition
in terms of living, those to survive who
will accept most patiently and at the lowest
wage the drudgery of minding machines.
That might go rather far; ultimately it
comes to absurdity. To whom at last
should they sell their goods? Not to the
impoverished workers of other industrial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
countries, defeated in the struggle. To
whom else? To the agricultural countries?
But these, for the reasons we have seen,
are tending as such to disappear. They
are buying machines. Italy brings nothing
to the solution. She is merely coming
tardily to do what others have done
to excess.</p>

<p>A brilliant Belgian economist suggests
that only the most efficient equipment will
survive, and only enough of that to satisfy
the natural demand for goods. All the
rest must be abandoned because there will
be no profit in working it. Well, it
remains to be seen if people will abandon
their machines without a struggle, purely
for rational reasons. Much more is it
likely that the higher cost of working the
less efficient equipment will be compensated
by a lower wage-rate, unemployment
being the workers’ alternative. Moreover,
if all the inefficient and unnecessary
machines were scrapped that would mean
only postponement of the sequel. The
competition would begin all over again.</p>

<p>There are those who suggest that we
are facing toward the mercantile system of
the Middle Ages, when it was the custom
for each nation jealously to protect its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
home-market from the competitive handicrafts
of other nations, and to prohibit or
punitively tax the exportation of raw
material to rival countries. So we are. To
say it is merely to indicate the rock upon
which, if nothing happens, the ship of
trade is bound to wreck herself.</p>

<p>A growing light on the actions of trade
as it is organized by the industrial powers
now impels nations hitherto agricultural
to found industries of their own. As
producers of foodstuffs and raw materials
to be exchanged for machine-products they
came to have a sense of being exploited.
In academic theory this was an exchange
by which the industrial nation satisfied its
food wants and the agricultural nation its
industrial wants, to mutual advantage.
But how came the industrial nation also to
acquire wealth by the transaction? Performing
the preferred industrial task, it
got not only its food but a profit over.
What else could it mean but that after a
series of years the industrial nation should
come to have large interest-bearing investments
in the agricultural country, owning
its railroads, tramways, water works, and
banks? What else could it mean but that
the richest country in foreign investments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
was the one that had been for the longest
time engaged in exchanging the surplus
product of its machines for the food and
raw materials of other countries? How was
it that those other countries, after having
served her for many years with food and
raw materials, invariably owed her a great
deal of money? Or, if you approach it
from the other point of view, you find in
the economic literature of industrial
nations a certain finished doctrine, which
is that the exchange of manufactured
goods for food and raw materials is a
business that pays. It is not primarily a
vital transaction. It becomes vital by
extension—that is to say, when in the
course of time the industrial population
has increased beyond the native food
supply. But in the beginning the motive
is gain. Nakedly, it is an exchange of
skilled labour for unskilled labour, to the
enrichment of the former; it is a division
of labour among nations on a kind of caste
plan.</p>

<p>There is much to be said for it. In no
other way could civilization have been
spread so fast; by no other method could
the world have become so rich in a few
years. There was much to be said, also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
for piracy. It diffused, manners, customs,
and wealth; it made peoples acquainted
with one another; it made a flat world
round and laid the foundations of modern
commerce. In the modern case all difficulty
begins when the peoples to whom the
less profitable tasks have been allotted
become intelligently dissatisfied and
resolve to change their status, as the
American colonists did, as the Japanese did,
as now all lusty nations are doing, last of
all the Chinese.</p>

<p>Modern trade evolved from piracy.
There was a time when all transfer of
goods between nations was by joyous
might. It is pleasant to believe that the
cause of the decline of piracy was a rise in
the moral sense of mankind. It is more
likely to have been the other way—that as
piracy declined for rational reasons rules to
govern commercial conduct became necessary.
To enforce the rules became everyone’s
duty. To break them was punishable.
From this would germinate a moral
sense. Piracy was bound to fail. On a
large scale, continuous and competitive,
it simply was not feasible. Competition
ruined it.</p>

<p>There was a marginal time in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
one was either pirate or trader, agreeably
to circumstance. The early Greek in his
dangerous ship never knew which he
was; nor did anyone else. He took when
the taking was good; when it was not, he
bartered. The Romans finally abolished
piracy in the Mediterranean, but on the
high seas it was the great romantic enterprize
down to a very recent time. Some
of its heroes are venerated as daring
navigators, pathbreakers of empire. It
takes some effort to remember that trees
are still standing that were already old
when the world was a place where finding
was keeping. If what you found was in
the possession of savages or heathens, you
exchanged for it the hope of civilization,
maybe a few glass beads. Toward the
end, this wonderful business began to be
hedged about with restrictions. You had
to be careful not to take anything forcibly
from people who had treaties of amity with
your own country, for if you did they
made trouble for you at home, diplomatically,
and you might even be hanged at the
end of an otherwise glorious voyage.</p>

<p>But if you swindled them in trade, that
was all right. Naturally, the first theory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of trade was to give the least and get the
most. There was else no point to it.</p>

<p>The significance of trade has fundamentally
changed in our time. What was a
private adventure has become a national
necessity, vital to the existing form of the
principal industrial states of the world.
And yet that first rude theory of it, representing
the step from piracy to commerce,
universally survives. This, at last, is the
crucial fact.</p>

<p>It has been impossible to part with the
notion that there must be gain in trade—a
profit on one side beyond the mutual satisfaction
of unlike wants with unlike goods.
Hence the term, balance of trade, meaning
the balance in your favour, or against you,
from the transactions of commerce. The
rule is that the industrial nations come out
each year with a balance in their favour.
The countries with whom they have been
exchanging machine-made goods for food
and raw materials owe them money. This
simply means that the industrial nations
charge more for what they sell than they
pay for what they buy. Hence the gain.
That is how they get rich. It is more than
a rule: it is the very principle of trade;
and if you say there is any other principle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the commercial mind becomes instantly
stark. What would activate trade if not
the hope of gain?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, trade on that principle is
bound to fail, as piracy failed, and for the
same practical reason. On a vast scale,
with unlimited participation, it is not continuously
feasible. Every nation cannot
have a favourable trade-balance. So long
as three or four nations had a monopoly
of machines and machine-craft, it could be
managed; it could even assume such
colossal proportions as to create the
illusion of being permanent as the way of
the world. That monopoly is broken. The
machine is increasingly a common possession.
Its power is dispersed, and there
is much new and unbidden ecstasy in the
exercise of it. And whereas it was that a
few nations exploited many, what now
opens to view is the prospect of all nations
simultaneously engaged in the effort to
exploit one another. Every frontier a
trade wall. Each nation forbidding others
to do unto it that which it is bent upon
doing to them. So we return to the middle
of the sixteenth century, no wiser than the
British were when the Parliament voted
<em>An Act Avoiding Divers Foreign Wares<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Made by Handicraftsmen Beyond the Seas</em>
(<em>5 Eliz. c. 7, Statutes of the Realm, Vol.
IV, Part I, pp. 428-429), 1562</em>. It reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Whereas heretofore the artificers of this
realm of England (as well within the city of
London as within other cities, towns, and
boroughs of the same real) that is to wit,
girdlers, cutlers, saddlers, glovers, point-makers,
and such like handicraftsmen, have been in
the said faculties greatly wrought, and greatly
set on work, as well for the sustentation of
themselves, their wives, and families, as for a
good education of a great part of the youth of
this realm in good art and laudible exercise:</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding so now it is, that by
reason of the abundance of foreign wares
brought into this realm from the parts of
beyond the seas, the said artificers are not only
less occupied, and thereby utterly impoverished,
the youth not trained in the said sciences
and exercises, and thereby the said faculties
and the exquisite knowledges thereof like in
short time within this realm to decay; but also
divers cities and towns within this realm of
England much thereby impaired, the whole
realm greatly endamaged and other countries
greatly enriched.</p>

<p>For reformation whereof, be it enacted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
our sovereign lady the Queen’s Highness, and
by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the
Commons of this present parliament assembled
and by the authority of the same, that no person
or persons whatsoever, from or after the
feast of the Nativity of St John Baptist now
next ensuing, shall bring or cause to be brought
into this realm of England from the parts
of beyond the seas, any girdles, harness for
girdles, rapiers, daggers, knives, hilts, pummels,
lockets, chapes, dagger-blades, handles, scabbards,
and sheaths for knives, saddles, horseharness,
stirrups, bits, gloves, points, leather
laces, or pins, being ready made or wrought
in any parts of beyond the seas, to be sold,
bartered, or exchanged within this realm of
England or Wales; upon pain to forfeit all
such wares so to be brought contrary to the
true meaning of this act, in whose hands soever
they or any of them shall be found, on the very
value thereof.</p>
</div>

<p>Shall it be either this again, or from a
universal war of machine-competition the
survival of one titanic industrial nation
with a monopoly of foreign trade and the
might to force its surplus goods on other
people’s markets? That nation would fall
in time and not altogether from its own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
weight. It would, of course, abuse its
power; but, moreover, it would be unable
to collect its favourable trade-balances
from all the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Logical extremes are fictions of thought.
It is always another thing that happens.
The one impossibility is for trade to wear
in its present character. It has come to the
end of its theory, witness the dread with
which European statesmen, economists,
and industrialists regard the payment of
German reparations. How shall Germany
pay? In goods. There is no other way.
She cannot pay in gold. There is not that
much gold in the whole world. The
Allied creditors actually lend her a little
gold in order that she may recover from
her amazing act of bankruptcy and get
back to the way of producing exportable
wealth. But to whom shall she deliver her
goods, or sell them? Great Britain does
not want them. Her anxiety is how to
keep her own factories going. They make
the same goods. France does not wish
them, nor Belgium, nor Italy, nor the
United States, and all for the same reason.
They have a potential surplus of industrial
commodities from their own machines.
Then shall Germany sell her goods in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
markets and turn the money proceeds over
to Great Britain, France, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al</i>? But they
themselves need those other markets on
which to sell their own industrial products.
German competition is not wanted there.
Thus an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">impasse</i>.</p>

<p>If, in desperation, the Allied creditors
forgave Germany her reparation debt, or
so much of it as she should be obliged to
pay in competitive goods, that would be
still worse. For Germany would then
compete in those other markets on her own
initiative and keep the profit. And all the
time those other markets, in Asia, Africa,
South America, tend to become less and
less exploitable because they belong to
people who have begun to found industries
of their own and are in the way to be
natively supplied with manufactures.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br>
<span class="fs70">DIM VISTAS NEW</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must occur to you that what the
world requires to find is a new conception
of commerce among nations—one that
shall be free of the predatory impulse,
above the exploiting motive, competitive
in some nobler sense. It need not be magnanimous
or unselfish—not yet; but only
enlightened enough to comprehend the
latter meaning of events.</p>

<p>For a superseding principle the perfect
pattern is represented in nature, where you
see dissimilar organisms existing together
in a state of symbiosis, one sustaining the
other, vitally interdependent, yet neither
exploiting the other.</p>

<p>There is no accrual of advantage to one
side, no gain, no favourable balance of
trade. One gives exactly as much as it
receives and two wants are equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
satisfied, with nothing to boot either
way.</p>

<p>This is very different from parasitism,
which is one-sided, for gain only. And
there is a very curious suggestion that
organisms now existing together in a state
of permanent symbiotic union were once
parasitic and learned better.</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed that nations will
ever deliberately substitute a principle of
mutualism for the principle of gain in
trade. They could not if they would.
Those that have the advantage must fight
for it to the end. Commerce itself, if you
look to it, is a complex structure of growth
for which there is nowhere any original
accountability. It cannot change its philosophy,
any more than a tree, for it has
none. It has instead a vital instinct for
opportunity and a flexible way with necessity
and circumstance. There is no hope
of its being reformed ideally by mass
intelligence. The conglomerate mind is
irresponsibly, impersonally selfish; it
cannot act without experience. There is no
experience of peoples sustaining one
another on a sympathetic plan, each willing
to give as much as it takes, with no balance
favourable or unfavourable to be settled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
gold or debt. This has never happened.
It is an idea only.</p>

<p>But if now we move our point of view
from the centre to the circumference, we
shall see already taking place, with the
force of natural events, momentous alterations
in the scheme of economic life—one
of decay and one of revaluation.</p>

<p>We witness almost unawares the ruin of
that classic enterprise of empire which is
founded upon the theory of a balance of
trade and a division of labour whereby the
colonies, the dominions, the subject and
mandated peoples are hewers, drawers,
and food-bringers, serving those who live
in cities, practise machine-craft, and think
themselves wholly benevolent.</p>

<p>The machine has betrayed it. Nothing
more unexpected has occurred since the
discovery of a simple chemical reaction
that was to destroy the privileged warrior-caste
among mankind. When a splendid
knight in armour was powerless against the
peasant with a musket and a knight with a
musket no better than a peasant, the
romantic profession of arms was doomed.
Gunpowder ended the age of chivalry.
Ultimate military power passed to the
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>And now for hundreds of millions of
people hitherto inferior in status the
machine is a symbol of liberation, freedom,
independence, recognition, racial power.
Japan is the thrilling example in Asia. Did
it not deliver her from a thraldom imposed
by the Western Powers in the interest of
their own trade? Did it not make her in
one generation their equal, a nation to be
feared? Certainly for these reasons use
and possession of the machine will increase
in the world beyond any natural economic
ratio, and both the power and profit of
empire will cease.</p>

<p>The other alteration, already beginning
to be visible though not yet adequately
understood, is a change in the value of
food. Three causes henceforth will be
operating together to make food dear.
First, as cities continue to grow and the
industrial population of the earth continues
to augment faster than the agricultural
population, the need to import food will
be always greater; second, the exportable
surplus of food will be always less because
as the agricultural and low-craft nations
progress toward their ideal of industrial
independence they will consume more and
more of their own food products; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
third, the supply of those industrial commodities
that are exchanged for food will
enormously increase.</p>

<p>In the language of the economist, the
agricultural index will rise and the industrial
index will fall. It will require a
greater quantity of manufactures to buy a
bushel of wheat; fewer bushels of wheat
to buy a manufactured article. This will
not be for one year or two. It will be
lasting. It will affect the status of great
groups and classes of people. In the cities
and industrial centres the cost of living
will move in a vertical manner.</p>

<p>The difficulties of food-importing countries
may, almost certainly will, become
desperate. The people of Great Britain,
for example, will pay dearly for the wealth
they have amassed by industry in the last
seventy-five years. If the value of food,
priced in British machine-wares, should
double, then for the same quantity of food
as before they would have to give twice
the quantity of manufactured goods, which
would mean twice as much labour and no
more to eat. The same difficulties will
beset all countries not self-contained in
food. They will exhort their people to
return to the fields, which the people will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
be loth to do, having tasted cities. They
will expect their governments to make
food cheaper by edict, or to buy it out of
taxation and distribute it gratis. Moreover,
in some countries, taking again the
case of Great Britain as notable, there may
not be enough land. The people perhaps
could not feed themselves no matter how
intensively they worked their fields,
industry having multiplied the population
beyond the utmost potentiality of a native
food supply. Obviously indicated is a
movement of dispersal together with a
limitation upon the increase of industrial
population. More power will pass to countries,
like the United States, Canada,
Brazil, and Australia, that have the advantage
of enormous food-reserves. Their
problems will be internal.</p>

<p>None of this can happen without much
blind and violent resistance. But, of
course, it will not happen all at once, not
all in one place, nor in every case with a
clear meaning. And it is not certain that
any amount of experience, however painful,
will bring nations to adopt what we
have called a symbiotic principle of commerce
with one another. There is at first
the danger that agriculture in its turn will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
exploit industry as industry has exploited
peasantry and that those who possess or
control resources of food and raw materials
will hold them too dear, thereby taking the
industrial nations into their debt or
provoking them to insane measures.</p>

<p>Thus the opportunity to go forward
might be lost in passion. The fate of
retrogression is possible. This has
happened many times. It is much less
probable than ever before, however, for
many reasons that seem permanent.
When knowledge was a precious torch
borne aloft by a few hands through
storm and stress, it was easily quenched.
Then darkness. You can hardly imagine
destruction of the existing body of science,
technology, and fact-knowledge. The
mass of it is too great to be lost.</p>

<p>That, of course, has nothing to do with
wisdom. By knowledge alone man might
extinguish himself utterly. But to suppose
that he will not find a new way to go on
with, that he will either move the old
struggle to new ground or return to
medievalism, is to believe there is no law
of human progress.</p>

<p>The probability is that he will find the
way unknowingly, by groping, and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
be well upon it before he has had time
to formulate any clear idea or theory of
what he is doing. He will have found
little by little that it pays, better than any
other way, not as he once understood
profit, but in terms of enduring satisfactions,
which may include peace. Critical
understanding of it will come later with
reflection, and as it comes he will rid his
mind of the phantasy in pursuit of which
he has made the world so much richer in
things than in happiness.</p>

<p>Seeing now only how relentlessly the
curse pursued him still and how the affliction
of monotonous toil if it be lifted in
one place is made heavier in another, he is
torn with a sense of frustration. But the
view is wrong—false to his first nature. He
forgets the truth of his own myth. Somewhere
down the ages it got turned upside
down. Once he dwelt in the Garden of
Eden, or supposed he did, and cared not
for it. He was bored there and beguiled
to his fall. The figure at the gate forbidding
his return is a symbol of self-knowledge;
it was set there by his own
forethought, lest he should be tempted to
go back.</p>

<p>If the machine with which he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
believed himself to be storming a childish
wish ever brought him to a state of
effortless ease on earth, that would be
his last.</p>

<p>It may be a power he is yet morally
unprepared to exercise. How strange at
least that with an incentive so trivial
and naïve in itself he should have been able
to perform an absolute feat of creation!</p>

<p>The machine was not. He reached his
mind into emptiness and seized it. Even
yet he cannot realize what he has done.
Out of the free elemental stuff of the
universe, visible and invisible, some of it
imponderable, such as lightning, he has
invented a class of typhonic, mindless
organisms, exempt from the will of nature.</p>

<p>We have no understanding of creation,
its process or meaning. The machine is
the externalized image of man’s thoughts.
It is furthermore an extension of his life,
for we perceive as an economic fact that
human existence in its present phase,
on its present scale, could not continue
in its absence. And what are we ourselves,
life to begin with, if not an image
of thought? Perhaps it is true as a principle
of creation that the image and its
creator must co-exist, inseparably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>In any light, man’s further task is
Jovian. That is to learn how best to live
with these powerful creatures of his mind,
how to give their fecundity a law and their
functions a rhythm, how not to employ
them in error against himself—since he
cannot live without them.</p>
